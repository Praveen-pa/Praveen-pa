## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate computer science student with an interest in solving real-world problems using AI, automation, and practical programming. With hands-on experience in Python, C, MySQL, and cloud platforms, I enjoy turning ideas into interactive, working products.

Currently, I’m exploring the power of **AI assistants**, **automated data pipelines**, and building a **Jarvis-style voice assistant** on limited hardware. I strongly believe in building one project at a time and learning by doing.
